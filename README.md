# 💰 Loan Status Prediction Using SVM

This project uses Support Vector Machines (SVM) to predict whether a loan application will be approved or rejected based on applicant financial data. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and includes features like credit history, income, loan amount, and more.

## 📌 Project Overview

- Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset: handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and scaled numerical features
- Used `train_test_split` to divide data into training and test sets
- Trained an SVM classifier and fine-tuned parameters to improve accuracy
- Achieved solid predictive performance in identifying loan approval outcomes
- Performed visual data analysis using Seaborn and Matplotlib

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Languages & Libraries:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **IDE/Tools:** Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains anonymized records of loan applicants with features such as income, marital status, employment, credit history, and loan details.
